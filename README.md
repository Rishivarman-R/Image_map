    <h3>The name Virudhachalam is a Sanskrit word that means "old mountain". It is made up of the words "vriddha" which means ancient and "achalam" which means unshakeable. 
        In Tamil, Virudhachalam is known as "Tirumudukuன்றம்" or "Pழமலை". The name was changed from Pazhamalai to Virudhachalam during the time of the Saivite Saints Appar, Gnanasambandhar, and Sundarar. 
        Here are some other facts about Virudhachalam:
        It is a town in the Cuddalore district of Tamil Nadu. 
        It is known for its ceramic industry. 
        The Viruthagerreswarar Temple is located in Virudhachalam. 
        According to legend, Sundarar came to Virudhachalam in his old age and sang praise of the Vriddhagiriswarar. Shiva was pleased with Sundarar's rendition and sent his son Muruga to take away Sundarar's belongings.
